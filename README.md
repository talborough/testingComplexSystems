This repo contains material used by the https://TestingComplexSystems.com web site. It is not version controlled like an ordinary git repo. Please see the website menu tab [Case Studies & Code] for more information.

Note this code can be (git) cloned and viewed on either Windows or UNIX-like systems but at this time it will only run on Linux. Please consult your favorite AI chatterbox for details on the issues involved. Just ask: "Python multiprocessing - Windows vs. Linux".
