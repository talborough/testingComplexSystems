CS03_Notes.txt - Presentation notes


Configuration of the test platform:

    (1) Control host running nfsTest
    (4) Test hosts (servers and clients) running NFS and ioEngine


NFS / test platform operation:

    1) Establish file system(s) on the server hosts and export them with NFS
    2) Import the above file systems on the client hosts with NFS
    3) Start using the imported file systems (ioEngine) on the client hosts
    
    4) Reboot server(s) and no client workloads should notice
    5) Reboot client(s) and account for aborted I/O operations
    6) Swap any host between a client and server role (remaining client workloads should not notice)


The goal:

    Accomplish #4, #5 and #6 above together, gracefully.
